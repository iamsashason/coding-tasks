Implement the is_continuous_sequence function, which checks whether the passed sequence is increasing continuous, i.e. the numbers in it follow one another without gaps. A sequence of one number is not considered as such.

Example:
is_continuous_sequence([4, 5, 6, 7])      # True
is_continuous_sequence([0, 1, 3])         # False
is_continuous_sequence([10])             # False
is_continuous_sequence([])               # False
