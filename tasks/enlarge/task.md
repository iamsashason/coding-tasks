Implement a function enlarge that takes an image as a two-dimensional list of strings and enlarges it by a factor of two, that is, doubles each character horizontally and vertically.

Example: 

frame = [
            "****",
            "*  *",
            "****"
]

enlarge(frame) = [
            "********",
            "********",
            "**    **",
            "**    **",
            "********",
            "********"
]
