Implement a function same_parity_filter that takes a list as input and returns a new list consisting of elements that have the same parity as the first element of the original list.

Example:
same_parity_filter([2, 0, 1, -3, 10, -2]) >>> [2, 0, 10, -2]
same_parity_filter([-1, 0, 1, -3, 10, -2]) >>> [-1, 1, -3]
