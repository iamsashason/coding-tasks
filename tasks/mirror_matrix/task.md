Implement a function mirror_matrix that takes a two-dimensional list (matrix) and modifies it so that the right half of the matrix becomes a mirror copy of the left half, symmetrical about the vertical axis of the matrix. If the matrix width is odd, the "middle" column should not be affected.
Example:
1 = [
[1, 2, 3],
[4, 5, 6]
]
mirror_matrix(1)
1 = [
[1, 2, 1],
[4, 5, 4]
]
