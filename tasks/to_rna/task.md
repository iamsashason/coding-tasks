DNA and RNA are sequences of nucleotides.
The four nucleotides in DNA are adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G) and thymine (T).
The four nucleotides in RNA are adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), and uracil (U).
The RNA chain is made up of the DNA chain by sequentially replacing each nucleotide:
• G -> C
• C -> G
• T -> A
• A -> U
Implement a function to_rna that takes a DNA strand as input and returns the corresponding RNA strand (transcribes the RNA).

>>> dna. to_rna(ACGTGGTCTTAA")
