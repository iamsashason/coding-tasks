Implement the find_longest_length function that takes a string as input and returns the length of the longest sequence of non-repeating characters. A substring can consist of one character. For example, in the qwearty string, you can select the following substrings: qwe, wegrty. The longest will be wearty, and its length is 6 characters.

Example:
find_longest_length('abcdeef') 
5
find_longest_length('jabjcdel')
7
