Implement a snail_path() function that takes a matrix as input and returns a list of matrix elements in clockwise order from the top-left element to the innermost element. The movement along the matrix resembles a snail.

Input matrix:
[1, 2, 3]
[4, 5, 6]
[7, 8, 9]
Output matrix:
[1, 2, 3]
[6, 9, 8]
[7, 4, 5]
