# Coding Tasks Collection

This repository contains my solutions to algorithmic tasks in Python. Here, I publish solutions to various problems along with tests to verify their correctness. The purpose of this repository is to showcase my approach to problem-solving and demonstrate my programming skills.

## Repository Structure

Tasks are organized into folders, each containing:
- Task description (`task.md`)
- Solution to the task (`solution.py`)
- Tests to verify the solution (`test_solution.py`)
