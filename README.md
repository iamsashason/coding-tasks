# Coding Tasks Collection

This repository contains my solutions to algorithmic tasks in Python. Here, I publish solutions to various problems along with tests to verify their correctness. The purpose of this repository is to showcase my approach to problem-solving and demonstrate my programming skills.

## Repository Structure

Tasks are organized into folders, each containing:
- Task description (`task.md`)
- Solution to the task (`solution.py`)
- Tests to verify the solution (`test_solution.py`)

## Content

1. [is_continuous_sequence](tasks/is_continuous_sequence/)
   - Task: Check if a sequence is continuous without any number gaps.
   - Solution: The `is_continuous_sequence` function verifies whether the sequence is increasing and continuous.
   - Tests: Verifying the correctness of the solution through various test cases.
