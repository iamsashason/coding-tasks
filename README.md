# Coding Tasks Collection

This repository contains my solutions to algorithmic tasks in Python. Here, I publish solutions to various problems along with tests to verify their correctness. The purpose of this repository is to showcase my approach to problem-solving and demonstrate my programming skills.

## Repository Structure

Tasks are organized into folders, each containing:
- Task description (`task.md`)
- Solution to the task (`solution.py`)
- Tests to verify the solution (`test_solution.py`)

## Content (in progress)

1. [is_continuous_sequence](tasks/is_continuous_sequence/)
   - Task: Check if a sequence is continuous without any number gaps.
   - Solution: The `is_continuous_sequence` function verifies whether the sequence is increasing and continuous.
   - Tests: Verifying the correctness of the solution through various test cases.

2. [find_longest_length](tasks/find_longest_length/)
   - Task: Find the length of the longest substring without repeating elements.
   - Solution: The `find_longest_length` function returns the length of the longest sequence of non-repeating characters.
   - Tests: Verifying the correctness of the solution through various test cases.
  
3. [triangle](tasks/triangle/)
   - Task: Write a function that returns a specified row of Pascal's triangle as a list.
   - Solution: The `triangle` function returns a specified row of Pascal's triangle as a list.
   - Tests: Verifying the correctness of the solution through various test cases.

4. [transposed](tasks/transposed/)
   - Task: Write a function that should accept a matrix as a list of lists and return the transposed matrix (a new list of lists).
   - Solution: The `transposed` function returns the transposed matrix.
   - Tests: Verifying the correctness of the solution through various test cases.

5. [sum_of_intervals](tasks/sum_of_intervals/)
   - Task: Write a function that takes a list of intervals as input and returns the sum of all non-intersecting interval lengths. 
   - Solution: The `sum_of_intervals` function returns the transposed sum of all non-intersecting interval lengths.
   - Tests: Verifying the correctness of the solution through various test cases.

6. [length_of_last_word](tasks/length_of_last_word/)
   - Task: Write a function that which returns the length of the last word of the string passed to the input
   - Solution: The `length_of_last_word` function returns the length of the last word.
   - Tests: Verifying the correctness of the solution through various test cases.

7. [chunked](tasks/—Åhunked/)
   - Task: Write a function which returns a list consisting of chunks of the specified size. 
   - Solution: The `chunked` function returns a list of chunks of the specified size.
   - Tests: Verifying the correctness of the solution through various test cases.

8. [hamming_weight](tasks/hamming_weight/)
   - Task: Write a function which calculates the Hamming weight of an integer.
   - Solution: The `hamming_weight` function returns the Hamming weight.
   - Tests: Verifying the correctness of the solution through various test cases.

## Installation and Running Tests

1. Clone the repository to your machine:
   `git clone https://github.com/iamsashason/coding-tasks.git`.
   
2. Go to the tasks directory:
   `cd coding-tasks/tasks/is_continuous_sequence`.
   
3. Make sure you have Python 3 installed. You can check the Python version with the command:
   `python3 --version`.
   If Python 3 is not installed, download it from the official Python website.
   
4. Run the tests with unittest:
   `python3 -m unittest test_solution.py`.
