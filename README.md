# Coding Tasks Collection

This repository contains my solutions to algorithmic tasks in Python. Here, I publish solutions to various problems along with tests to verify their correctness. The purpose of this repository is to showcase my approach to problem-solving and demonstrate my programming skills.

## Repository Structure

Tasks are organized into folders, each containing:
- Task description (`task.md`)
- Solution to the task (`solution.py`)
- Tests to verify the solution (`test_solution.py`)

## Content (in progress)

1. [is_continuous_sequence](tasks/is_continuous_sequence/)
   - Task: Check if a sequence is continuous without any number gaps.
   - Solution: The `is_continuous_sequence` function verifies whether the sequence is increasing and continuous.
   - Tests: Verifying the correctness of the solution through various test cases.
  
## Installation and Running Tests

1. Clone the repository to your machine:
   `git clone https://github.com/iamsashason/coding-tasks.git`.
   
2. Go to the tasks directory:
   `cd coding-tasks/tasks/is_continuous_sequence`.
   
3. Make sure you have Python 3 installed. You can check the Python version with the command:
   `python3 --version`.
   If Python 3 is not installed, download it from the official Python website.
   
4. Run the tests with unittest:
   `python3 -m unittest test_solution.py`.
